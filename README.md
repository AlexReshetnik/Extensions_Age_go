# Extensions_Age_go
 
During the development of projects, it was often necessary to copy and peek at parts of the code from past projects, so
I saved everything on the PC, and in git everything was in one repository (AllProjectForStyding), now
I sorted everything and created a separate repository

An interesting and simple extension for chrome whose task is to set the main page as a count of the number of years and % how many are left until the birthday
